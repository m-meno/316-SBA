Reflection:

Moving forward I could plan out which parts of my webpage will satisify each and every requirement in the SBA before getting started. I did try to do this, but at the end there were a couple requirements I hadn't met and I had to refactor some of my other code. I had a difficult time with the 316 R lab and was unable to get the submenus to appear when toggling the active class. For this project I tried to pracice adding and removing the active click and getting the <p> to appear when the anchor tag was clicked. This was challenging but I was able to get that to work. If I had more time I would add more stylign and experiement with changing the image source on with mouseenter and mouseout events. I would also add more features.
